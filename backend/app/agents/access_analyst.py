    Steps
    -----
    1. For each candidate venue, call Mapbox Isochrone API.
    2. For each member location, call Google Distance Matrix.
    3. Score accessibility (penalise "close but slow" venues).
    4. Generate GeoJSON isochrone blobs for frontend rendering.
    5. Return updated state with accessibility_scores + isochrones.
